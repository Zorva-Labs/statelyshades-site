Thanks for the inquiry on {{interest}} — got it in front of me and I would love to set up a quick in-home consultation so I can take measurements, show samples, and put together exactly the right options for your home.

What does the rest of this week look like for you? I can usually get out within a day or two. If a phone call is easier first, my number is 629-298-8241.

Looking forward to it,

Just confirming your free consultation for {{appointment_date}} at {{appointment_time}}.

Address on file:
{{address}}

I will bring the full sample kit (faux wood, real wood, cellular, roller, solar, woven, plantation shutter sections) so we can compare side by side in your actual light. Typically takes 30-45 minutes per main living area.

If you need to reschedule, just text 629-298-8241 — no problem at all.

See you then,

Quick follow-up to the consultation — I have put together three options at three price points so you can see exactly how the numbers move with material choice.

You can view the proposal here:
{{proposal_link}}

The link is yours to come back to anytime. Once you are ready, accepting on the proposal moves it straight to a contract — no second round of paperwork.

Any questions, just reply here or call/text 629-298-8241.

Thanks for accepting the proposal — the contract is ready for your signature here:
{{contract_link}}

Once it is signed I will get the order placed and reach out to schedule install. Lead times for most products are 2-6 weeks; I will give you a tighter window the moment the order goes in.

Reply with any questions or hit me at 629-298-8241.

Great news — your install is on the calendar for {{appointment_date}} at {{appointment_time}}.

I will be at:
{{address}}

I usually need a couple of hours per main area (more for plantation shutters or motorized setups). Pets are no problem — just give me a heads-up.

Day-of, if anything shifts, I will text. Otherwise see you then.

It was a pleasure working on your home. Every product is covered under manufacturer warranty plus 90 days of workmanship on the install itself — anything goes sideways, text or call and I will be back out.

If you are happy with the work, a quick Google review would mean a lot. It is how a local shop like this stays going:

And of course if anyone you know is shopping for window treatments, send them my way.

Just circling back on your {{interest}} project — let me know if anything has changed on your end or if there is anything I can clarify on the options we discussed.

Happy to send updated samples by mail if it helps.
